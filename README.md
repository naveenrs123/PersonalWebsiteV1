# Naveen's Personal Website (Version 1.0)
This is a personal website that allows me to showcase my skills and experience, and share information about myself with those who are interested. 

## Technologies Used
I have coded this website using HTML, CSS and small amounts of Javascript/JQuery. JQuery was used to implement smooth scrolling behaviour with appropriate offsets and to animate the opening of the details in the project section.

I employed CSS Flexbox styling frequently due to its versatility and powerful positioning features, resulting in a lightweight, responsive website that achieves my needs.

Version 1.0 is quite simple and doesn't utilize more complex technologies and front-end Frameworks like Angular or React, but I am to incorporate these technologies into future projects and/or revisions of my personal website.
